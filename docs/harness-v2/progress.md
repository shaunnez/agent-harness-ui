## Open questions for Shaun

_None yet. Append here rather than blocking, unless proceeding would be unsafe._

## Findings

_Anything measured or learned that changes the plan. Append-only._

### F1 (Phase 0) — the eval lab has never been used

29 tasks in the store, all terminal, spanning 2026-08-06 to 2026-08-14. Every single one has
`experiment: null` and `evaluation: null`. Every one has `workflowProfile.selected = "standard"`
with `source: "migration"` — meaning no task has ever been routed by the profile selector
either; they were all backfilled to standard.

Consequences for the plan:

1. **Phase 6 cannot be a replay of history.** There is no experiment metadata on any historical
   task to re-run against. Phase 6's small/medium/large runs are fresh baselines, not
   comparisons. The plan's Phase 6 wording stands, but nobody should read its output as
   "topology X beat topology Y" — it is "topology X was observed to execute".
2. **The instrument is untested, not just uninstrumented.** `normalizeExperimentInput` and
   `controlledSummary` in `server/evaluation.mjs` have unit tests but have never processed a
   real run. Phase 1 must not assume they work in anger.
3. **Real comparison needs ~20+ paired runs that do not exist yet.** Accumulating them is the
   long pole of this whole effort, and it starts only after Phase 1. Everything before that
   is scaffolding.

This does not change the phase order — measurement still comes first, because without Phase 1
the runs we start accumulating are unmeasurable. It does lower the confidence attached to any
Phase 6 conclusion.

### F2 (Phase 0) — field name for Phase 1

The profile lives at `workflowProfile.selected`, not `workflowProfile.id`. Phase 1's topology
snapshot should sit alongside it as `workflowProfile.topologyId` / `.topologyVersion`, or in the
experiment record — decide when implementing, but do not invent `.id`.
